A coworker shared with me a reel of a streamer playing this game and thought it looked like a lot of fun, so I decided to recreate it.
The same coworker also shared an interesting insight, he pointed out that in this game, if you destroy your enemy, you end up getting destroyed too. 
I found thai idea very philosophical and amusing.

Enjoy.
